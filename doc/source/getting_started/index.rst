Getting started
===============

Here are some guidelines to use the ``pydita-ast`` package.
One can keep in mind that each steps can be modified to fit
with its own project.


Pre-defined format
------------------

The conversion is based on a pre-defined XML directory format and 
it is recommended to comply with it. 
The expected format is as follow:

.. include:: ./images/diags/diag_directory.rst


Template directory
------------------

The ``_package`` directory is the template that will be followed by the
autogenerated pacakge.


Converting an XML-directory
---------------------------

Once the ``XML_directory`` is correctly organized, the converter can be used.

.. code:: bash

    python xml2rst.py -p XML_directory_path

Once the directory is converted, the Sphinx documentation can be generated.
The generated documentation is by default contained in the ``package`` directory.

The following code is to render the documentation as an HTML one from Windows:

.. code:: bash

    cd package
    pip install -e .[doc,tests] # Using a virtual environment is recommended.
    .\doc\make.bat html 


.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:
