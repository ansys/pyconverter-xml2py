Getting started
===============

This section provides some guidelines for using the ``pydita-ast`` package.
You can modify each step as needed to convert your own DITA XML documentation.


Predefined format
-----------------

The conversion is based on a predefined XML directory format that you
should comply with it. Here is the expected format:

.. include:: ./images/diags/diag_directory.rst


Template directory
------------------

The ``_package`` directory is the template that is followed by the
autogenerated package.


Converting an XML directory
---------------------------

Once the ``XML_directory`` is correctly organized, you can use this command
to run the converter:

.. code:: bash

    python xml2rst.py -p XML_directory_path


If you need to customize some functions, you can specify the path containing the
Python files:

.. code:: bash

    python xml2rst.py -p XML_directory_path -f customized_function_directory_path


For more information, see :ref:`ref_source_code`.

After the converter runs, you can generate Sphinx documentation. This code renders
the documentation as HTML from Windows:

.. code:: bash

    cd package
    pip install -e .[doc] # The use of a virtual environment is recommended.
    .\doc\make.bat html 


Autogenerated package
---------------------
By default, the Sphinx documentation is contained in the autogenerated ``package``
directory. This diagram presents the format of this directory:  

.. include:: ./images/diags/diag_package.rst
