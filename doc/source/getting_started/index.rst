Getting started
===============

Here are some guidelines to use the ``pydita-ast`` package.
One can keep in mind that each step can be modified to fit
with its own project.


Pre-defined format
------------------

The conversion is based on a pre-defined XML directory format and 
it is recommended to comply with it. 
The expected format is as follows:

.. include:: ./images/diags/diag_directory.rst


Template directory
------------------

The ``_package`` directory is the template that will be followed by the
autogenerated package.


.. include:: ../../../README.rst
    :start-line: 60

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:

    source_code
    objects
